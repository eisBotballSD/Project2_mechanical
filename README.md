## Project2 Mechanical and Code Review - Greater San Diego Region: Elementary Institute of Science (Team #0337)

### Part list required to construct the system or subsystem:
* KMP (KIPR Metal Part) Angle Bracket.
* 2 medium bolts, 2 lock nuts
* 5 hole straight LEGO piece
* one long bolt and lock nut
* motor mount
* two medium bolts and lock
* Servo - 2 plastic pop rivets and 2 medium bolts with nuts
* 5 hole aluminum servo horn
* silver screw
* motor mount and using two long bolts and 2 nuts
* Axel Joiner 3 long with 4 pins
* Servo # 2 - 2 plastic pop rivets and 2 medium bolts with nuts
* 5 hole aluminum servo horn
* silver screw
* curved LEGO piece
* two pins
* one long bolt and lock nut
* ET sensor with two medium screws


### Goal or purpose of the system or subsystem:
* To get the firefighters out of the tube and move them into the fire station by stacking them.

### System or subsystem operating to complete goal or purpose:
* We followed the instructions for building the demobot arm and grabber and then added the ET sensor below to find the tube with firefighters
* System has worked pretty consistently but the sensor stopped working after awhile so we had to replace it and retest
* See youtube video for working system: https://youtu.be/unIb9PL2Sd4

### Description of how it was tested:
* We set it up in a certain area of the board and tested it multiple times to see if the claw would grab the firefighters and stack them in a certain area.
* Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, we kept track of the times it worked and the times it didn't.
